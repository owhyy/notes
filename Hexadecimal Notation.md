# Hexadecimal Notation
#Programming 
+ because it's a pain to write [[Information Notation#Information storage|bytes]] as 0000000, we use hexadecimal notation:
	+ starts with `0x`
	+ values 0-9 and letters A-F (af) -> 16 possible values (base-16)
	+ this makes a byte writable as characters in the range `00-FF`
